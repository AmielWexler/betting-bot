  "content": "Value betting is the practice of betting when the probability of an outcome is greater \n                than the probability implied by the bookmaker's odds.\n                \n                Key Principles:\n                1. Calculate true probability of outcomes\n                2. Compare with bookmaker's implied probability\n                3. Bet when you find positive expected value\n                4. Use proper bankroll management\n                \n                Example: If you calculate Liverpool has 60% chance to win, but odds imply 50% (2.00 odds), \n                this represents value.\n                \n                Risk Management:\n                - Never bet more than 2-5% of bankroll on single bet\n                - Track all bets and results\n                - Focus on long-term profitability\n                - Avoid emotional betting",
